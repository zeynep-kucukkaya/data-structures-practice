# Data Structures and Algorithms Applications

This repository contains Python implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms, developed with a focus on understanding efficiency, memory usage, and real-world application scenarios.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to strengthen problem-solving skills by implementing core data structures and applying them to practical use cases commonly encountered in software and system development.

## Implemented Structures
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Hash Tables

## Practical Use Cases
- Task scheduling using queues
- Data buffering with stacks
- Fast data access using hash tables
- Priority-based processing concepts

## Technologies Used
- Python

## Motivation
This project is part of my self-directed learning process to build a strong foundation in data structures and algorithmic thinking.

## Project Status
- Actively maintained and expanded
